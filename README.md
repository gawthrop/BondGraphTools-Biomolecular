# BondGraphTools-Biomolecular
This repository contains
1. Extensions to BondGraph tools to support stoichiometric analysis (.py)
2. Tutorials and examples as jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)
3. PDF versions of the notebooks (.pdf). These contain a table of contents as well as citations.

## Examples
- [ECR](ECR.pdf): Enzyme-catalysed Reactions
- [Cooperative](Cooperative.pdf): Cooperative Enzyme-catalysed Reactions
- [Phosphorylation](Phosphorylation.pdf): Phosphorylation, Dephosphorylation and the Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade
